## It's okay to say 'hello' In Chat!

> 'Time is money', that's a monstrosity. Time is not money, time is the tissue of our life. - **Antônio Candido** 

You don’t necessarily need to have a very important topic or question to send a **‘Hi, How are you?’** to a co-worker on Slack or Discord. No one is so busy that they can't stop for 5 minutes to respond to **'Good Morning'**.

Today we live in a tired society where everything is very fast and our time is considered money, but this is not the case, not everything is profit. So, take at least a minute to wait and reply **‘Good morning!’**, it won’t interfere with anything.

After that may come an interesting topic or an important question in your busy workday...

### For example:

- `9:34 Arthur Dent:` Hello Ford, how are you?
- `9:35 Ford Prefect:` Hi, everything is fine!
- `9:40 Arthur Dent:` Ok then :)
- `9:40 Arthur Dent:` I have a question, if you have time.
- `9:45 Ford Prefect:` Sure, what is it?
